To Go Further
-------------

:Warning: The development of PyDvi is on standby since several years now.

Some idea to go further:

* implement an OpenGL based viewer, actual Qt rendering is inefficient
* use Freetype to render the glyph, cf. http://code.google.com/p/freetype-gl and distance field
  rendering technique
* review the font manager
* review the DVI machine
* review everything
* try pypy

.. End
