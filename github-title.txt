PyDvi is a Python module which is able to read DVI files generated by LaTeX and files like packed font, tex font metric, font map and font encoding. The module provides a DVI machine as a base class which can be extended by the user and plugged to a TeX daemon in order to render contents on-the-fly. Also the source code provides as example a DVI viewer featuring an hardware accelerated rendering on GPU.
