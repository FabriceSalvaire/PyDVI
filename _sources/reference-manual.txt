 API Documentation
===================

This is the auto-generated API documentation for the PyDvi library.

.. note:: The docstings and the code need a review. Most of the code was written a long time ago
	  (for Python 2.4).

.. warning:: The API documentation is automatically generated from the docstrings in the source
  using the |Sphinx| tool.  This way to produce the documentation is know to be perfectible
  actually, but not too bad.
